# Cloning Troubleshooting Guide

If you are having trouble cloning a repository, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:

## Step 1: Check Git Installation
1. Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux).
2. Type the following command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
3. If Git is installed, you will see the version number. If not, download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

## Step 2: Verify Repository URL
1. Ensure that you are using the correct repository URL. The format should be:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. If the URL contains query parameters (e.g., `?sandbox=zr8zny`), remove them and use only the base URL.

## Step 3: Check Network Connection
1. Ensure that your internet connection is stable.
2. Try accessing the repository URL in a web browser to see if it is reachable.

## Step 4: Use Command Prompt Correctly
1. Make sure you are in the correct directory where you want to clone the repository.
2. Use the command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

## Step 5: Additional Help
If you continue to experience issues, please provide the exact error message you receive when attempting to clone the repository. This will help in diagnosing the problem further.
